## To get started

### Prerequisites


You will need 
- [python](https://www.python.org/) to run the backend 
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the front-end
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download and update the code.


### Installation

- First clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jere344/lightnovel-crawler.git
```

- Open command prompt inside of the project folder and install requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements-bot.txt
```

- Move into lncrawl/bots/web2/react-app/ and install requirements :

```bash

## Start the website

### Run the developement server

- First start the backend bot

```bash
python lncrawl --bot web2
```

- Then start the frontend server
```bash
$ cd lncrawl/bots/web2/react-app
$ npm start
```

### Adding a novel to the server

- Visit `http://localhost:3000/addnovel` or just click on `Add Novel` on the website and in the search bar type in a novel's name or a URL of a novel from a supported source. 
- If you search using a novel's name there will be multiple sources from which you can add novel to the server. You can check out a source by clicking on the URL of the novel and it should open in a new tab.

### Run the production server
You will need to install serve
```bash
cd lncrawl/bots/web2/react-app
$ npm install -g serve
```

- Edit the configuration file `lncrawl/bot/web2/flask_api/config.json` with your domain name:
```json 
"website_url": "https://lncrawler.monster",
"api_url": "https://api.lncrawler.monster",
```

- Copy the configuration file to the frontend folder :
```bash
$ cp "lncrawl/bots/web2/flask_api/config.json" "lncrawl/bots/web2/react-app/src/"
```

- Start the backend bot
```bash
python lncrawl --bot web2
```

- Build the frontend
```bash
$ cd lncrawl/bots/web2/react-app
$ npm run build
```

- Serve the frontend server
```bash
$ cd lncrawl/bots/web2/react-app
$ serve -s build
```

For the rest you will need some kind of reverse proxy like nginx or apache2 to serve the backend and the frontend.
